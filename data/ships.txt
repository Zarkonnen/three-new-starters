	description `The StarGate Inc. SpaceJumper is the smallest craft capable of fitting a hyperdrive. It's sold in kit form and advertised to "everyone who ever wanted their own spaceship". Most buyers who manage to assemble the ship make one terrifying trip to Alpha Centauri and back, and then sell the thing for scrap.`

	description `A bare-bones asteroid mining ship derived from the popular Sunder class. Comfort and cargo space have been sacrificed for the ability to mount two mining lasers.`
	description `	The ship is manufactured and marketed by a subsidiary of Syndicated Shipyards, who boast that it comes with an asteroid scanner as standard. Which is true, but it's a woefully underpowered entry-level device.`
